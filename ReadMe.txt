Assignment 2:	: Simulating a Roller Coaster
Author		: Colin Cammarano
USC ID 		: 8085947576

Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher - Y

2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : - Y
  level 2 : - Y
  Level 3 : - Y
  Level 4 : - Y
  Level 5 : - Y

3. Used Catmull-Rom Splines to render the Track - Y

4. Rendered a Rail Cross Section - Y
	- Used vertex colors, so the corners of the tube are hard to pick out. The cross section is fully functional, however.

5. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation - Y

6. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) - Y

7. Understandably written, well commented code - Y

8. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots - Y

9. Attached this ReadMe File - Y

Extra Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Render a T-shaped rail cross section - N

2. Render a Double Rail - N

3. Made the track circular and closed it with C1 continuity - N

4. Added OpenGl lighting - N

5. Any Additional Scene Elements? (list them here)

6. Generate track from several sequences of splines - Y

7. Draw splines using recursive subdivision - N

8. Modify velocity with which the camera moves - N

9. Create tracks that mimic a real world coaster - N

10. Render environment in a better manner - N

Open-Ended Problems: (Please document approaches to any open-ended problems that you have tackled)
1. N/A
2. N/A

Keyboard/Mouse controls: (Please document Keyboard/Mouse controls if any)
1. r: resets the rollercoaster ride
2. esc: ends the application
3. x: take a screenshot
4. q: start animation!
